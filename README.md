 ####Overview
Play as Beemo, a League of Legends character who must go along his way and
collect items and defeat enemies to reach the other side of the map and save 
his friend, the Poro, only by defeating the final boss, the Nexus Turret! 
Uncover sparkles to reveal basic items that can 
boost his initial stats, defeat minions to gain better items with stronger
stat boosts, and collect bees to fuel his attacks!
