# Final Project: Beemo's Adventures

**Author**: Sue Wee - [`swee4@illinois.edu`](mailto:example@illinois.edu)

This libary uses the CinderBlock ciAnimatedGif logic from user cwhitney. 

Play as Beemo, a League of Legends character who must go along his way and
collect items and defeat enemies to reach the other side of the map, defeat the
boss, and reach the goal! Uncover shiny spots to reveal basic items that can 
boost his initial stats, defeat minions to gain better items with stronger
stat boosts, and collect bees to fuel his attacks and deal stronger attack damage! 

Note: Currently only a grid will load, and it can not yet load in full interactive maps.

In order to run this project, create a CMake Application to run the my_app.cc code.
